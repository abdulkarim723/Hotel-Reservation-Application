# Hotel-Reservation-Application
This project was developed from me from scratch. I developed this application as it is a part of my [Java Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-nanodegree--nd079)  
This is a terminal application for hotel reservation system. There is no database for the application as the pass-criteria was about the logic, layering and software development in Java itself, at least this is my understanding and my motivation to program this application. Exception handling is done for many cases where the user can not insert invalid input.
The application is self-explained.
